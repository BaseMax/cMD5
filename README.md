# cMD5

Implement MD5 encryption using c without openssl and extra library.

## Features

- Small, Tiny, Pure `c` code
- Not depends on `openssl` and other
- Works as well in `Linux` and `Windows`

## MD5

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

## Compile

```
gcc example.c -o md5 -lm
./md5
```

## Tested on

- Gnu/Linux gcc
- Windows Mingw

Maybe there is **memory problem** in code, please report this.

## Main Implement

- MD5 Crypto in Linux: https://code.woboq.org/linux/linux/crypto/md5.c.html
- https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Md5.c

## References

It's not a own work, and depends on MD5 algorithms.
It's only a test purpose to implement md5 algorithm in c without extra library. Tested on for windows and linux.
